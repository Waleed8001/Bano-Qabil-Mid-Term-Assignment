# Hospital Appointment Scheduler
We make a Project by using <b>Python</b> scripts in which we made an <b>Automated System</b> of <b>Appointment Scheduler</b> of those <b>Patients</b> who have <b>registered</b> in the <b>Hospital</b> to take <b>Appointment</b> on the <b>desired Doctor's timing</b>.
<br>Patient's records will be stored in a <b>Google Spreadsheet</b> and <b>Python</b> scripts will take records of the <b>Patients</b> and send <b>Email</b> to the <b>Patients</b> for the <b>Appointment</b>.
<br>Major Works in this Project are:
1. We used <b>requests</b> library for <b>Taking, Editing</b> and <b>Deleting</b> records of the patients according to the conditions.
2. We used <b>datetime</b> library to take <b>Current date</b> such that <b>Email</b> sent those people who have <b>Registered</b> for the current date(Not all the Patients).
3. We used <b>smtplib</b> library for <b>Sending Messages</b> easily through <b>Gmail</b>.
